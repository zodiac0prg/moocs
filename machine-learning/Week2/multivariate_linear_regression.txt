Multiple features
------------------
House prices example:
Now have more features (information) regarding each data-point.

n = number of features
m = number of samples

x^(i) : features of the ith training sample : nth dim feature vector
x(j) ^ (i) : jth feature of the ith training sample


hypothesis now changes to:
h (theta)(x) = theta0(x)(0) +  theta1(x)(1) + theta2(x)(2)+...theta(n)(x)(n)

where (x)(0) = 1

h = theta'X

where theta' = transpose of theta (which is a 1 x (n+1) row vector)
and X = is a ((n+1) x 1) column vector.
