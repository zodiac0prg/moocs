Example:
Email foldering/tagging: Work, Friends, Family, Hobby
Medical diagnoses: Not ill, Cold, Flu
Weather: Sunny, Cloudy, Rain, Snow

y can take a small number of discrete values as opposed to just binary.

Each of these discrete values are called classes.

One vs All (One vs Rest)
------------------------

Idea is to apply binary logistic regression classifier repeatedly
by consider each class as a positive class and the remaining values as
negative class.

On a new input x, to make a prediction, pick the class i that maximizes

max (for i) h (theta) (x) (for that classifier i)
