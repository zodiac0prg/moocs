Classification
--------------

Consider the problem of classifying if a tumor is malignant or not based on the input of tumor size.

At first, it seems like the linear regression model can be used as a classifier. But there are problems:

1) It might work for a particular example, but not all examples.
2) For a binary classification problem (such as this tumor example), where the output is usually 0 or 1,
the prediction h(x) could give values that are < 0 or > 1. This is odd and not ideal.

For this reason, linear regression does not help and we would need a different model.

::Introducing Logistic regression.

oddly termed "regression", although logistic regression is really a classifier.

Hypothesis Representation
-------------------------

Logistic regression uses a sigmoid function...
g(n) = 1 / (1 + e^(-n))

where n = (theta)' * x;

the sigmoid function asymptotes to 1 as n tends to infinity and asymptotes to 0 as n tends to (-infinity).

Logistic regression estimates the probability that y = 1 on an input x.

h(theta)(x) = probability that y = 1, given x, parameterized by 0.

Decision boundary
------------------

h (theta)(x) >= 0.5 , then y = 1
else y = 0

so for the case of a sigmoid function, g (theta' * x) >= 0.5 when (theta' * x) >= 0

The decision boundary are based on the paramter theta and NOT on the training set itself.
