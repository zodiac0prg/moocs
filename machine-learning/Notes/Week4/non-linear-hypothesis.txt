Non-linear classification
-------------------------

For more number of features and quadratic hypothesis, you will have almost O(n^2)
features...

This will result in overfitting, and also computationally this would be very challenging.

Neural networks
---------------

background: neurons and the brain

Neuron model: Logistic unit

x0 (bias unit) (..implied =1)
theta : parameters of the model (aka weights of the model)

The neural network could consist of multiple layers...
the first layer is the input layer, the last layer is the output layer..
the intermediate layer are called hidden layer(s).

a(i)(j) activation of unit i in layer j

theta(j)'s dimension is s(j+1) x (s(j) + 1)
