thetas: parameters

How do we choose these thetas? i.e. how do we come up with a straight line that best represents our training set.

Idea: choose thetas so that h is close to y for our training samples (x,y)

minimize average sum for all samples i from 0 to m
((h(x)(i) - y(i)) ^ 2)/ (2 * m)

The above expression is called the cost function denoted by J(theta0, theta1). This cost function is called sqaured
error function. This is most ideal choice for most linear regression problems.

Intuition 1
-----------

Plot J by considering theta0 as 0 and varying theta1 i.e. y intercept on the line is always zero.

Intuition 2
-----------

Now consider both theta1 and theta2. Contour plots.
