Linear regression with one variable.

Supervised learning: you are given the "right answers". Eg. housing prices in a city. This is also a "Regression
problem": predict real-valued output.

The right answers are called training set.

Notations:
m : number of training examples
x's : input variables / features
y's : output variables / target

(x,y) : single training sample
[x(i), y(i)] : is the ith training sample

		size of house-> h -> Estimated price
			x						y

h: hypothesis
h maps from x's to y's

How do we represent h?

h(theta)(x) = (theta0) + (theta1)x
shorthand : h(x)

or in other words: an eqn of a straight line:

Why linear? use this as a base for learning more complex learning algos.

This is also known as univariate linear regression.
